Description:
Pet class issue when controlling summons

Current behaviour:
In the SMV quest "Frankly, It Makes No Sense..." the player is required to control the mechascorp thing to tag diemetredons.
When attempting this quest previously I was unable to interact with the control console.
This time, I decided to dismiss my pet prior to using the console and it worked.

Expected behaviour:
The player is able to interact with the console despite having a pet out.

Steps to reproduce the problem:

    Step 1 Accept the quest and head to the consoles.
    Step 2 Summon a felguard or other pet - I was unable to get confirmation whether hunters experience this problem.
    Step 3 Attempt to use the console.
    Step 4 Dismiss pet and then you will be able to use the console.
