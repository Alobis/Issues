Description:
Pet follow no longer causes pet to return to side while in combat.
Player making this entry is a warlock with felguard.
Hunter has mentioned the same issue in guild chat.

Current behaviour:
Pet follow no longer causes pet to return to side while in combat. It will instead stop attacking and stay in place..

Expected behaviour:
Pet follow should cause pet to stop attacking and return to the owner's side while in combat.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Put pet on passive
2. Enter combat
3. Send pet to attack and stand at distance to make it obvious when it is or isn't returning
4. Press follow and it should stay still.
